# weather-tracker

A simple weather tracking site that allows users to toggle between cities to see the current weather in addition to the 5-day forecast.

## Description

A weather dashboard that allows users to toggle between multiple cities of interest to see the current weather and a five-day forecast. This is a group project exploring the use of 3rd-party APIs as well as DOM manipulation.
